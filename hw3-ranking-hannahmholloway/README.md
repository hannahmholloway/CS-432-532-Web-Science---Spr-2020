# Homework 3 - Ranking Webpages
**Due:** Tuesday, February 25, 2020 *before class*

## Assignment

Write a report that answers the following questions.  Your GitHub repo should include all scripts, code, output files, images needed to complete the assignment.

**Q1.**  Download the content of the 1000 URIs from HW2.  `curl`, `wget`, or `lynx` are all good candidate programs to use.  We want just the raw HTML, not the images, stylesheets, etc.

Examples from the command line:

`% curl http://www.cnn.com/ > www.cnn.com`

`% wget -O www.cnn.com http://www.cnn.com/`

`% lynx -source http://www.cnn.com/ > www.cnn.com`

<nolink>`www.cnn.com` is just an example output file name, keep in mind that the shell will not like some of the characters that can occur
in URIs (e.g., "?", "&").  You might want to hash the URIs to associate them with their respective filename, like:

```
% echo -n "http://www.cs.odu.edu/show_features.shtml?72" | md5
41d5f125d13b4bb554e6e31b6b591eeb
```

(`md5` might be `md5sum` on some machines; note the `-n` in echo -- this removes the trailing newline.)

Now use a tool to remove (most) of the HTML markup for all 1000 HTML documents. `python-boilerpipe` will do a fair job, see 
http://ws-dl.blogspot.com/2017/03/2017-03-20-survey-of-5-boilerplate.html:

```{python}
	from boilerpipe.extract import Extractor
	extractor = Extractor(extractor='ArticleExtractor', html=html)
	extractor.getText()
```

Keep both files for each URI (i.e., raw HTML and processed). Upload both sets of files to your GitHub repo.

**Q2.**  Choose a query term (e.g., "shadow") that is not a stop word (see Week 5 slides) and not HTML markup from step 1 (e.g., "http")
that matches at least 10 documents (hint: use `grep` on the processed files).  If the term is present in more than 10 documents, choose
any 10 from your list.  (If you do not end up with a list of 10 URIs, you've done something wrong).

As per the example in the Week 5 slides, compute TFIDF values for the term in each of the 10 documents and create a table with the
TF, IDF, and TFIDF values, as well as the corresponding URIs.  Rank the URIs in decreasing order by TFIDF values.  For
example:

Table 1. 10 Hits for the term "shadow", ranked by TFIDF.

|TFIDF	|TF	|IDF	|URI
|-----:|--:|---:|---
|0.150	|0.014	|10.680	|http://foo.com/
|0.044	|0.008	|10.680	|http://bar.com/

You can use Google or Bing for the DF estimation.  To count the number of words in the processed document (i.e., the deonminator
for TF), you can use `wc`:

```
% wc -w www.cnn.com.processed
    2370 www.cnn.com.processed
```

It won't be completely accurate, but it will be probably be consistently inaccurate across all files.  You can use more 
accurate methods if you'd like, just explain how you did it.  

Don't forget the log base 2 for IDF, and mind your [significant digits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Significant_figures#Rounding_and_decimal_places)!

**Q3.**  Now rank the same 10 URIs from Q2, but this time by their PageRank.  Use any of the free PR estimaters on the web,
such as:
* http://pr.eyedomain.com/
* http://www.prchecker.info/check_page_rank.php
* http://www.checkpagerank.net/
* https://dnschecker.org/pagerank.php
* https://smallseotools.com/google-pagerank-checker/

If you use these tools, you'll have to do so by hand (they have anti-bot captchas), but there are only 10 to do.  Normalize the
values they give you to be from 0 to 1.0.  Use the same tool on all 10 (again, consistency is more important than accuracy).  Also
note that these tools typically report on the domain rather than the page, so it's not entirely accurate.  

Create a table similar to Table 1:

Table 2.  10 hits for the term "shadow", ranked by PageRank.

|PageRank	|URI
|-----:|---
|0.9|		http://bar.com/
|0.5	|	http://foo.com/

Briefly compare and contrast the rankings produced in Q2 and Q3.

## Extra Credit

**Q4.** *(Extra credit, 3 points)* Compute the Kendall Tau_b score for both lists (use "b" because there will likely be tie values in the rankings).  Report both the Tau value and the "p" value.

See: 
* http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2557863/measures-of-association-in-r-kendalls-tau-b-and-tau-c
* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_tau_rank_correlation_coefficient#Tau-b
* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence


**Q5.**  *(Extra credit, 3 points)*  Compute a ranking for the 10 URIs from Q2 using Alexa information (see Week 4 slides).  Compute the correlation (as per Q4) for all pairs of combinations for TFIDF, PR, and Alexa.

Here's the Alexa ranking for odu.edu: https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/odu.edu#section_traffic

**Q6.** *(Extra credit, 3 points)*  Build a simple (i.e., no positional information) inverted file (in ASCII) for all the words from your 1000 URIs.  Upload the entire file your GitHub repo and discuss an interesting portion of the file in your report.

## Submission

Make sure that you have committed and pushed your local repo to GitHub.  

Submit the URL of your report in Blackboard:

* Click on HW3 under Homeworks
* Under "Assignment Submission", click the "Write Submission" button.
* Copy/paste the URL of your report into the edit box
  * should be something like https<nolink>://github.com/cs432-websci-spr20/hw3-ranking-*username*/blob/master/report.{pdf,md}
* Make sure to "Submit" your assignment.
