  The past four years I've spent coding in object-oriented languages (Java and C++) which are nearly *100% logic*. 
Programs built with these languages tends to do nothing until **everything _works_**. This made it ***hard*** to teach 
and self-learn as there is little feedback unless you write your own logging, which is a skill in and of 
itself. Because of this, `JavaScript` was easy to grasp for me and allowed me to have fun with graphics.

    int main(int argc, char** argv)
    {
     if (argc != 3)
    {
    std::cout << "Usage:  assignment08 [input file] [output file]" << std::endl;
    return 0;
	    }
