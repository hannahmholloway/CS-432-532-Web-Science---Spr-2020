Subject: CS381 honors contract course option

I will be teaching Discrete Structures CS381 in spring 2020 . I will offer an optional project to challenge students beyond the level required by the course . Successful completion of the project will earn an honor's label for this course on the transcript.  You might see an element of the example in Michael's page ( link below ) regarding B-spline . I found him in my 381 class . He worked with me for about two years in bioinformatics research and published three papers as an undergraduate student . He finished MS degree last year . If you have questions , please feel free to contact me .
