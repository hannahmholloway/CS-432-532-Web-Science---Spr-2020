Subject: book : Reminder: Alpha Sigma Tau Survey of Alumnae and Supporters

Dear Hannah , Not long ago , you likely received a message asking for your participation in a survey of Alpha Sigma Tau alumnae and supporters . Of course , we understand that this is a period of significant disruption and concern for all of us , so if you're focused on things other than surveys , we completely understand . If , however , you can spare a few minutes , we would be grateful for your participation . The first phase of this research closes on April 20th . Click here to start the survey . The initial set of questions should take approximately seven minutes to complete . After that , you'll have the option of stopping or answering additional questions . The information you provide will remain completely confidential and help us create programs and services that more effectively communicate , inspire and connect with our members . Thank you for your interest and your time ! With thanks , Kris Haskin ( Beta Pi 1987 / Eastern Illinois )
